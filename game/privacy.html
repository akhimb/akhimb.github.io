AndroMom Numbers: Privacy policy
Welcome to the AndroMom-Numbers game for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by tiny card games. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

This app is designed to help preschoolers to learn numbers easily with drawing games.
This app doesn't contain inappropriate content to any age group.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
